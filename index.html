                    <p>Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star
                        – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the
                        center of our solar system. The Sun is about 93
                        million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth,
                        and without its energy, life as we know it could
                        not exist here on our home planet.</p>
                    <p>The Sun is the largest object in our solar system.
                        The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it.
                        Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping
                        everything from the biggest planets to the smallest
                        bits of debris in orbit around it. The hottest part
                        of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million
                        degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius). The Sun’s
                        activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady
                        stream of charged particles it sends out, influences
                        the nature of space throughout the solar system.</p>

                    <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger
                        than Earth's Moon.</p>
                    <p>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when
                        viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its
                        proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs
                        to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to
                        rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing
                        happens in reverse at sunset.</p>

                    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of
                        the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s
                        similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however – there are radical
                        differences between the two worlds.</p>
                    <p>Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in
                        thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect.
                        It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface
                        temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to
                        melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and
                        thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active.
                    </p>
                    <p>Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to
                        the pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.</p>

                    <p>The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.</p>
                    <p>Earth's Moon is the fifth largest of the 200+ moons orbiting planets in our solar system.</p>
                    <p>Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.</p>

                    <p>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.</p>

                    <p>Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.</p>
                    <p>Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.</p>

                    <p>It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Bode.​</p>
